   <h1 align="center">Bus Topolgy<br></h1>

In this type topology all types of nodes such as computer, mobile and other devices are connected with one main cable, also called the backbone of Bus Topology. This cable is usually made of co-axial or optical fibre. There are two terminators at both ends of this line.

The data flow is bidirectional. When sending data, the sender computer sends the same data to every other connections in the line, but the sender can chose which connection would receive the data and which would not. 
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Advantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Best suited for small network.</li>
<li>Less costly and easy to maintain.</li>
</li>Addition of new users does not         
    hamper other users.</li>
<li>New nodes can easily be added by 
     using connectors or repeaters so 
     expansion is easier.</li> 
<li>Requires less cable than other 
     topologies.</li>
<li>Other networks are not affected by 
     troubles of another.</li>
<li>No central device or server is needed.</li>
</ol>
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Diaadvantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Entire network shuts down if there is  
    problem in the main cable.</li>
<li>Detecting problems created in this network is difficult.</li>
<li>If the number of computers increases      
    then huge traffic problems occur &  
    data transmission speed gets slow.</li>
<li>High risk of data collision.</li>
</ol>
<br>

  <h1 align="center">Ring Topology<br></h1>

The physical ring topology in which the computer nodes are connected to each other in a circular loop of point to point links. Each computer connected gets equal right to transmitted data. There is no central computer in this topology. When a data is sent it keeps going in a circle to the same direction untill it goes through a loop. The First computer in this network is connected to the last computer. 
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Advantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Does not require a host computer.</li>
<li>Since data flow is unidirectional, data collisions do not occur.</li>
<li>Each computer gets equal Importance.</li>
<li>Less amount of wiring is needed, so  
    cost is lower. </li>
<li>Easter to troubleshoot because each 
    device incorporates a repeater.</li>
<li>By increasing the number of 
    computers one cannot influence it's 
    capability.</li>
</ol>  
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Disadvantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>If one computer of this network stops 
    working, whole system drops.</li>
<li>Identifying problems is difficult.</li>
<li>Adding or removing new networks 
    disrupts the entire network.</li>
<li>Signal exchange is relatively slow.</li>
<li>Computers are unable to send data 
   directly due to one-way round 
   connections.</li> 
<li>Controlling this topology requires 
    complex software.</li>

   <h1 align="center">Star Topolgy<br></h1>    

The topology in which computers or various electronic devices are directly interconnected through a hub, switch or host computer is known as Star topology. Computers connected here exchange data with the hub, switch or host computer. As a result, less time is required for signal exchange and less chance of signal collision Signal Flow is bidirectional. It is easier to identify problems as there a central computer. Various types of cables are used in this topology, although twisted pair cables are more commonly found. 
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Advantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Data exchange is relatively fast.</li>
<li>Less risk of signal collision.</li>
<li>New nodes can easily be added to the 
     network at any time while keeping the 
     entire network operational.</li>
<li>Even if one node gets disconnected, 
     the other networks remain functional.</li> 
<li>As analysis of traffic is easy, the 
     topology poses great high data 
     security.</li>
<li>Even if number of computers 
    increases, the speed of data 
    transmission remains normal.</li> 
<li>The centralized network management     system helps in monitoring the network.</li>
<li>Variety types of cable can be used.</li>
</ol> 
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Disadvantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>If the hub or central computer is 
   down, the entire network becomes 
   useless.</li>
<li>Each node requires a separate table 
    so the cost is relatively high.</li>
<li>Networked computers are not able to 
    directly exchange information.</li>
</ol>

    <h1 align="center">Tree Topolgy<br></h1>
  
In a tree topology, computers or nodes are arranged and connected to each other like branches of a tree. Also known as hierarchical structure of computer network. An extended form of star network. It consists of multiple tiers of computer connected to a central host computer. Different levels of devices are connected to this host computer through network hub or switches according to hierarchy. In this a arrangement, each layers of computer acts as an intermediate host of the text layer's computers. A computer after which no other computer is connected is known as peripheral terminal. Networks of tree topology are easily expandable. In this case the data flow in bidirectional.
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Advantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>It's network can easily be expanded by 
     creating new branches at any time.</li>
<li>Offers advantages over other 
     topologies in building large networks.</li> 
<li>Networks are not disturbed if a  
     new node is added or removed.</li> 
<li>Data security is paramount.</li>
<li>Office management with this network 
    is very effective.</li>
</ol> 
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Disadvantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Damage of main computer, damages the entire network.</li> 
<li>This topology is quite critical.</li>
<li>Cost is relatively high and difficult to configure.</li>
</ol>

    <h1 align="center">Mesh Topolgy<br></h1>

A topology when one computer is directly networked with every other computers. Does not require a central server. Relatively fast data exchange. The mutual connection between these networked computes is calad point-to-point link. Also known as completely interconnected topology. This topology is very expensive as a lot of cables are required and has a really complex configuration. The total number of cables can be found by using the formula :  n(n-1)\2. Where 'n' is the total number of devices in a connection. Mesh topology is used in cases where reliability of data communication is important, such as defense or banking.
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Advantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Data transmission rate is very high.</li>
<li>Adding new devices does not affect 
    the transmission speed.</li>
<li>Even if any computer on the network 
    gets damaged, others will still be 
    functional.</li> 
<li>No central device is required in this
    network.</li> 
<li>Network problems can easily be 
    solved.</li>
<li>Data communication has more
     certainty.</li>
</ol>
    <br>
    <br>
<b><u>Disadvantages</u></b>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Very Expensive, as a lot of cables are      
     used.</li>

    <h1 align="center">Bluetooth<br></h1> 
An open wireless technology standard for transmitting electronic data over short distances between any device that has bluetooth connection. 
<br>#Telecom vender company <b>Ericsson</b> inverted this in 1994. 
<br>#Named after a king, <b>Harold Bluetooth of Denmark</b>.
        
       <h3 align="center">Bandwidth</h3>
A synonym often used for data transmission speed. The maximum rate of data or bit transmitted per second is usually expressed in bps (bit per second)
<br>3 types of bandwidth:
<br>
<br>
<b>Narrow Band :</b> Another name in sub-voice. Speed is 45-300 bps. Applied to low speed data transmission. Like Telegraphy, walkie-talkie, pagar, keyboard etc.
<br>
<br>
<b>Voice Band :</b> Speed is 300-9600 bps. One of the most important uses of voiceband was the dial-up modem used to access the Internet. Now it is used in card readers, printers etc.
<br>
<br>
<b>Broad Band :</b> Also known as Wide Band. Speed is more than 1 Mbps. The fastest data sharing method. Uned in satellite communication, microwave, optical fibre etc.        
        
 <h3 align="center">Data Communication</h3> 
<br>Data communication is a process of using computing and communication technology to transfer data from one place to another and vise versa.
<br>
<br>
Data communication has two types of data transmission:
<br>
<br>
<b>1. Date transmission mode:</b><br>
   Refers to the mechanism of transferring data between two devices connected over network. This modes direct the direction of flow of information, also known as communication mode.
<br>
<b>2. Data transmission flow</b><br>
There are three types of data transmission more depending on the flow of data transmission.

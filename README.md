<h1 align="center">Topologies</h1>

<p>
Bus Topolgy
In this type topology all types of nodes such as computer, mobile and other devices are connected with one main cable, also called the backbone of Bus Topology. This cable is usually made of co-axial or optical fibre. There are two terminators at both ends of this line.

The data flow is bidirectional. When sending data, the sender computer sends the same data to every other connections in the line, but the sender can chose which connection would receive the data and which would not.




Advantages:

Best suited for small network.
Less costly and easy to maintain.
Addition of new users does not hamper other users.
New nodes can easily be added by using connectors or repeaters so expansion is easier.
Requires less cable than other topologies.
Other networks are not affected by troubles of another.
No central device or server is needed.


Diaadvantages:
Entire network shuts down if there is problem in the main cable.
Detecting problems created in this network is difficult.
If the number of computers increases then huge traffic problems occur & data transmission speed gets slow.
High risk of data collision.

Ring Topology
The physical ring topology in which the computer nodes are connected to each other in a circular loop of point to point links. Each computer connected gets equal right to transmitted data. There is no central computer in this topology. When a data is sent it keeps going in a circle to the same direction untill it goes through a loop. The First computer in this network is connected to the last computer.




Advantages:

Does not require a host computer.
Since data flow is unidirectional, data collisions do not occur.
Each computer gets equal Importance.
Less amount of wiring is needed, so cost is lower.
Easter to troubleshoot because each device incorporates a repeater.
By increasing the number of computers one cannot influence it's capability.


Disadvantages:
If one computer of this network stops working, whole system drops.
Identifying problems is difficult.
Adding or removing new networks disrupts the entire network.
Signal exchange is relatively slow.
Computers are unable to send data directly due to one-way round connections.
Controlling this topology requires complex software.

Star Topolgy
The topology in which computers or various electronic devices are directly interconnected through a hub, switch or host computer is known as Star topology. Computers connected here exchange data with the hub, switch or host computer. As a result, less time is required for signal exchange and less chance of signal collision Signal Flow is bidirectional. It is easier to identify problems as there a central computer. Various types of cables are used in this topology, although twisted pair cables are more commonly found.




Advantages:

Data exchange is relatively fast.
Less risk of signal collision.
New nodes can easily be added to the network at any time while keeping the entire network operational.
Even if one node gets disconnected, the other networks remain functional.
As analysis of traffic is easy, the topology poses great high data security.
Even if number of computers increases, the speed of data transmission remains normal.
The centralized network management system helps in monitoring the network.
Variety types of cable can be used.


Disadvantages:
If the hub or central computer is down, the entire network becomes useless.
Each node requires a separate table so the cost is relatively high.
Networked computers are not able to directly exchange information.

<h1 align="center">Tree Topolgy<br></h1>
In a tree topology, computers or nodes are arranged and connected to each other like branches of a tree. Also known as hierarchical structure of computer network. An extended form of star network. It consists of multiple tiers of computer connected to a central host computer. Different levels of devices are connected to this host computer through network hub or switches according to hierarchy. In this a arrangement, each layers of computer acts as an intermediate host of the text layer's computers. A computer after which no other computer is connected is known as peripheral terminal. Networks of tree topology are easily expandable. In this case the data flow in bidirectional.




Advantages:

It's network can easily be expanded by creating new branches at any time.
Offers advantages over other topologies in building large networks.
Networks are not disturbed if a new node is added or removed.
Data security is paramount.
Office management with this network is very effective.


Disadvantages:
Damage of main computer, damages the entire network.
This topology is quite critical.
Cost is relatively high and difficult to configure.

<h1 align="center">Mesh Topolgy<br></h1>
A topology when one computer is directly networked with every other computers. Does not require a central server. Relatively fast data exchange. The mutual connection between these networked computes is calad point-to-point link. Also known as completely interconnected topology. This topology is very expensive as a lot of cables are required and has a really complex configuration. The total number of cables can be found by using the formula : n(n-1)\2. Where 'n' is the total number of devices in a connection. Mesh topology is used in cases where reliability of data communication is important, such as defense or banking.




Advantages:

Data transmission rate is very high.
Adding new devices does not affect the transmission speed.
Even if any computer on the network gets damaged, others will still be functional.
No central device is required in this network.
Network problems can easily be solved.
Data communication has more certainty.


Disadvantages:
Very Expensive, as a lot of cables are used.
Network installation and configuration is very complex.
